        <h2>Understanding your Ayurvedic skin type: </h2><br>
        <div id="intro">
            Ayurveda has been practised for millennia, and it is founded on the idea that the human body is guided by
            three
            Doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. According to Ayurveda, how the Doshas are balanced at any particular time
            determines
            every biological function of the body as well as your Ayurvedic skin type. Each person's Vata, Pitta, and
            Kapha
            doshas are balanced differently, and each person's Vata, Pitta, and Kapha balance is unique.Ayurvedic skin
            treatments are mostly centred on determining the body's Dosha type before recommending a treatment plan that
            includes habits, nutrition, and other factors. The Doshas must be balanced in order for the various organs
            and
            the body as a whole to operate properly.

            The Dosha also deciphers skin issues, as it does with other Ayurvedic therapies. Let's have a look at how
            each
            Dosha affects the skin in different ways.

        <h2>The Different Body Types : </h2><br>
        <div id="bodytypes">
            <div id="type">
                <h4>Vata Dosha</h4>
                With <a href="body-types/vata.html">vata skin type</a>, the skin is more likely to be rough and dry, requiring regular moisturising.
                Moisturisers
                with a certain amount of oil in them perform wonderfully for this skin type. For this skin condition,
                Ashwagandha supplements are also indicated.
            </div>
            <br><br>

            <div id="type">
                <h4>Pitta Dosha</h4>
                The <a href="body-types/pitta.html">pitta skin type </a>is diametrically opposed to that of a Vata-dominant Dosha. When Pitta is the
                dominant
                Dosha,
                the person's skin might be greasy, and they are more susceptible to allergies and a range of skin
                disorders.
                Cooling treatments, such as Sandalwood, Aloe Vera, should be utilised on this type of skin.

            <br><br>
            <div id="type">
                <h4>Kapha Dosha</h4>
                The <a href="body-types/kapha.html">Kapha skin type</a> is quite similar to that of a Pitta person. Oily skin is prone to acne and other
                skin
                concerns. This skin type benefits greatly from exfoliation. There are different names which are more
                common
                that
                one might be aware of. Following are the simplified and popular terms for these skin types.

        <div id="remedies">
            <div id="type">
                <h4>Exfoliate your skin using natural ingredients</h4><br>
                Exfoliation is necessary for maintaining healthy and clean skin. Fruit acids are commonly used as
                chemical
                exfoliants, while Ayurvedic scrubs and masks can be used as physical exfoliants. Salt works well as a
                natural
                exfoliator. When it comes to a healthy body exfoliation, salt is a great alternative since it helps to
                remove
                the rough and dry patches of dead skin. Sugar is frequently used to exfoliate the skin. Choosing sugar
                over
                salt
                to avoid the sting is the greatest option.

                <h4>Nourish your skin with herbal oils</h4><br>
                Herbal oils contain natural properties that improve the health of your skin, promote moisture, and aid
                in
                the
                removal of blemishes. Some oils may even help you to get rid of significant skin problems including
                eczema,
                psoriasis, and acne. Because of its soothing and healing properties, ayurvedic oils can help reduce
                stress,
                which can harm your skin.

                <h4>Use Winsoria Oil</h4>
                Winsoria Oil has been proved extremely effective in reducing symptoms of hyperkeratinization,
                inflammatory
                reactions, silvery scales, as well as skin discoloration associated with Psoriasis. Winsoria oil
                Phyto-ingredients, i.e., Manjishta, Vidapala, and Sariba blended together with a foundation made with
                coconut oil, helps in avoiding skin itching and also puts a stop to sores and scale development.

                Psoriasis is a skin condition in which the patient's skin turns red, rashes appear, and plaques with
                scales
                appear. Psoriasis can be treated using Winsoria oil. The anti-inflammatory properties of the Winsoria
                oil
                prevent the treated area from drying out. Psoriasis of any kind can be treated with Winsoria oil.
