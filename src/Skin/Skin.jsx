        <h2 className='skin-h2'>Understanding your Ayurvedic skin type:</h2><br />
        <div id="skin-intro">
          Ayurveda has been practised for millennia, and it is founded on the idea that the human body is guided by
          three
          Doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. According to Ayurveda, how the Doshas are balanced at any particular time
          determines
          every biological function of the body as well as your Ayurvedic skin type. Each person's Vata, Pitta, and
          Kapha
          doshas are balanced differently, and each person's Vata, Pitta, and Kapha balance is unique. Ayurvedic skin
          treatments are mostly centred on determining the body's Dosha type before recommending a treatment plan that
          includes habits, nutrition, and other factors. The Doshas must be balanced in order for the various organs
          and
          the body as a whole to operate properly. The Dosha also deciphers skin issues, as it does with other Ayurvedic
          therapies. Let's have a look at how each Dosha affects the skin in different ways.

            <h4>Vata Dosha</h4><br />
            With vata skin type, the skin is more likely to be rough and dry, requiring regular moisturising. Moisturisers
            with a certain amount of oil in them perform wonderfully for this skin type. For this skin condition,
            Ashwagandha supplements are also indicated.

          <div id="skin-type">
            <h4>Pitta Dosha</h4><br />
            The pitta skin type is diametrically opposed to that of a Vata-dominant Dosha. When Pitta is the
            dominant Dosha,
            the person's skin might be greasy, and they are more susceptible to allergies and a range of skin disorders.
            Cooling treatments, such as Sandalwood, Aloe Vera, should be utilised on this type of skin.

          <br /><br />
          <div id="skin-type">
            <h4>Kapha Dosha</h4><br />
            The Kapha skin type is quite similar to that of a Pitta person. Oily skin is prone to acne and other skin
            concerns. This skin type benefits greatly from exfoliation. There are different names which are more common
            that one might be aware of. Following are the simplified and popular terms for these skin types.

            <h4>Exfoliate your skin using natural ingredients</h4><br />
            Exfoliation is necessary for maintaining healthy and clean skin. Fruit acids are commonly used as chemical
            exfoliants, while Ayurvedic scrubs and masks can be used as physical exfoliants. Salt works well as a natural
            exfoliator. When it comes to a healthy body exfoliation, salt is a great alternative since it helps to remove
            the rough and dry patches of dead skin. Sugar is frequently used to exfoliate the skin. Choosing sugar over
            salt to avoid the sting is the greatest option.
