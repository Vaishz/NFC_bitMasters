            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The digestive system is a group of organs working together to convert food into energy and basic nutrients to feed the entire body. It involves the breakdown of food into smaller and smaller components until they can be absorbed and assimilated into the body.</p>

          <section className="dig-how-it-works">
            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>The digestive system starts at the mouth and includes the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, and rectum. Each part of the system plays a critical role in breaking down food and absorbing nutrients.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Mouth:</strong> Where digestion begins with chewing and saliva.</li>
              <li><strong>Esophagus:</strong> Transports food to the stomach.</li>
              <li><strong>Stomach:</strong> Breaks down food with acid and enzymes.</li>
              <li><strong>Small Intestine:</strong> Absorbs nutrients through its lining.</li>
              <li><strong>Large Intestine:</strong> Absorbs water and forms waste.</li>
              <li><strong>Rectum:</strong> Stores and excretes waste.</li>
            </ul>
